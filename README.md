A project based on SDG 5 Gender Equality

## Getting Started
A project about Gender equality that built using:
1. Flutter
2. Backend using Supabase

It has 5 features in it:
1. A Forum/Chat feature
2. A news feature
3. A feature to write a inspiration or to inspire
4. A feature to view said inspiration
5. A feature that provides free education on the internet

It is my final project for PLP. Specifically my area of specialization which is Mobile application develepment.
